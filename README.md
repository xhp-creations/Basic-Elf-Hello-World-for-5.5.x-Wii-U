# Basic-Elf-Hello-World-for-5.5.x-Wii-U
A very basic Elf Hello World example for 5.5.x Wii U that works

There is a lot of source code for Elf files for the Wii U, but a lot of it was made for versions other than 5.5.x firmware, so I created this Hello World example for 5.5.x users to be able to get an easy start on their own code.

Must have DevKitPro installed, along with libogc.  If you don't want to use the portlibs, then just remove the references in the makefile, although I recommend that you install them.
